    <center><p>Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there </br>to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look </br>out for your best interest. <strong>This kind of friend can be hard to find,</strong> <em>but they offer a friendship</em> that will </br>last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal</br> is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their <font color=blue>inspiration</font> from the joy brought about by a loving</br> <u>friendship</u> or the pain caused by a failed friendship.</p>
