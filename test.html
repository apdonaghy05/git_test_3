    <p>Friendship is one of life's greatest treasures. Friends that are loyal are always there </br>to make you laugh when you are down, they are not afraid to help you avoid mistakes and they look </br>out for your best interest. This kind of friend can be hard to find, but they offer a friendship that will </br>last a lifetime. Other friends may not be quite as loving. The pain caused by a friendship marred by betrayal</br> is not easy to overcome. In fact, many poems find their inspiration from the joy brought about by a loving</br> friendship or the pain caused by a failed friendship.</p>
